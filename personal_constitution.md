title: Personal Constitution of Jon Bake
---

## Preamble

I, Jon Bake, believe in the health of mind, body, soul, and character.  To ensure the health of my mind, I will always be reading a book of value.  I will use meditation and visualization daily to calm my mind and visualize the person I want to become.  In employment, I will have a job or own a business that requires great mental capacity and in my job I will give my full effort.

The body is the dwelling place for the soul.  It is of utmost importance to maintain the health of my body.  I will be active every day, with either cardiovascular activities or weight training or both.  I will only feed my body clean whole foods.  I will not pollute my body with drugs or alcohol.

I will be a man of character.  Above everything, I will always tell the truth and trust in being myself.  I will be radically open-minded. I will live by Christian values- love your neighbor as yourself, help out others, do not judge.  I will not be defined by material possessions.  I will live debt free and give to help others.  I will develop good habits and eliminate bad ones.  I will be goal driven.  I will give thanks every day for the blessings in my life.

> "The unexamined life is not worth living" - Socrates

I believe in living a conscious life and this constitution will serve as a blueprint for doing so.

## Principles

### 1 - Nurture and Create New Relationships

All the magic happens in life from the relationships you establish. Prioritize relationships with family and good friends. Seek out new friendships.

### 2 - Enjoy the Ride

Life is too short to be anything but happy. If you are unhappy, have the courage to make the
necessary changes to be happy again. Bad things will happen. Accept what you must, change
what you can. Keep things in perspective.

### 3 - Always Be Open to New Experiences - Conquer Fear

Life is full of amazing experiences. But these experiences are only available to those who have the courage to act. I
will embrace every new experience that life has to offer. I will take advantage when opportunity arises.

### 4 - Live Debt Free/Be Non-Materialistic

Debt adds stress. Material possession will not make you happy. For happiness, see Principle #1.

### 5 - Have a Growth Mindset - Always be Learning Something New

Every day is an opportunity to learn and grow. I will do my best to take advantage of that
opportunity. Just about anything can be changed with hard work and the right mindset.

### 6 - Be Passionate

No man has ever been successful without finding his passion and doing everything in his power
to live that passion. Whatever you choose to do, make sure it is something that you can be
passionate about.

### 7 - Help Others - Give of Yourself

I am blessed. I have a duty to pass on my blessings to others. The only thing that stays behind
when you leave this earth is the good that you have done.

### 8 - Live Healthy, Eat Well, Be Active and Clean

I have one body, one mind, one life. It is precious, and I will do everything in my power to protect
it.

### 9 - Be Grateful

Be thankful you are blessed!

### 10 - Establish Habits and Systems to Ensure Success

95% percent of everything you do in a given day is the same thing you did the day before. Make sure these reoccurring tasks align with the person you want to become. Goals are great for short term successes. Habits and systems are better since they ensure life-long success.

### 11 - Live in the Moment

The future and past are abstractions. All there is is right now. Make sure you are taking full
advantage of the present. Use meditation and mindfulness practices to be more in the moment.
Enjoy Life!

### 12 - Work Hard, Sweat, Finish Each Day Exhausted

Every day, you should give 100% of yourself physically and mentally.

### 13 - Love Well

Family, friends, acquaintances, and even strangers. We are all sharing a common experience. Love is what makes the experience worth living. Love is compounding. Always be asking yourself, "Did I love well?"
