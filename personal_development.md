These are the personal development tools I currently employ.

## Personal Constitution

My [Personal Constitution](/personal_constitution) describes the values I aspire to live up to. I review it frequently to make sure I am indeed living my values. I update it when I read, hear or discover some other principle I want to incorporate into my life.

One of the principles in my _Personal Constitution_ is to "Establish Habits and Systems to Ensure Success"...

### Daily Habits

[Daily Habits](/daily_habits) are positive activities I try to do just about everyday.
