    - What are my bad habits?
- "Manners are the lubricating oil of an organization"
    - Action: say people's name periodically while in conversation

    - in a small or large organization?

## Values

- Ask what are my values?
- Important to match personal values to values of organization one works for

## Other Questions/Ideas

This is a book of great questions to ask oneself:

- What are my strengths? Make sure to double down on them.
- How do I perform? What are my values?
- Given my strengths, my way of performing, my values, how can I make the greatest contribution to what needs to be done [in the organization I am working for]?
- Set SMART goals in 18 month time frameâ€” Where and how can I achieve results that will make a difference within the next year and a half?
- What are strengths, performance modes, values of co-workers? (if don't know, ask; be open to telling yours to them)
- Organizations are no longer built on force but on trust
- Have a secondary interest that has possibility of forming second career.
