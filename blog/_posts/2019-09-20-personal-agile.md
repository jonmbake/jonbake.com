I tried just about every personal productivity system out there-- everything from [GTD](https://gettingthingsdone.com/) to daily planners. They would stick for a week or two, but slowly I would lose interest. It always seemed like the overhead of maintaining the system outweighed the benefits.

Earlier this year, we adopted the [Agile](http://www.agilenutshell.com/) framework [Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-scrum) for our software development methodoly at work. As we were apopting _Scrum_, an idea popped into my head. Agile would work great as a personal productivity system. Shortly after that ah-ha moment, I put _Personal Agile_ into practice. This is how I currently do it. (One of the principles of Agile is embrace change so my process will continue to evolve).
