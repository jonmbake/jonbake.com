title: Creating a Genome-based Personal Health Plan
---

Earlier this year, I had my DNA genotyped by [23andMe](23andme.com). My hope was to get a better understanding of my ancestory and how genetics play a role in my overall health. Upon receiving my results from _23andMe_, I was happy to discover they had a number of health reports. The health reports were great, but I knew they were just the tip of the iceburg; there was more valuable health information in my genome. Fortunatley, _23andMe_ offers a genome export and there are third party services out there that will run analysis on genomes to try and tease out more health information.

I used a couple of these third party services and created a personal health plan based on the results. The two services I found most useful are:

- [Dr. Rhonda Patrick's Comprehensive Genetics Report](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/genetics)

- [Promethease](https://promethease.com)

The following is my genome-based health plan.

## Avoid Dairy (Lactose)

**Gene:** [MCM6 gene](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/MCM6)

**SNP:** [rs4988235(C;C) SNP](https://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Rs4988235)

The _(C;C) genotype_ was **completely correlated** with biochemically verified lactose intolerance in [this study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11788828?dopt=Abstract).

## Supplement with Vitamin D

**Gene:** [vitamin D binding protein](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2638)

**SNP:** [rs7041(G;T)](https://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Rs7041)

The _(G;T) genotype_ may increase the risk of vitamin D deficiency according to [this study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S096007601000172X?via%3Dihub#bib40).

It's important to optimize serum Vitamin D levels because it has been associated with [increased mortality](https://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g6330).

I put a a drop or two of [Optimal Vitamin D3 Liquid](https://amazon.com/Servings-Physician-Formulated-Seeking-Health/dp/B003800UXG) in my morning smoothy. I still have to do blood tests to ensure my serum Vitamin D levels are in the 40-60 ng/L range.

## Perform Intense Exercise Regularly

**Gene:** [BDNF](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/BDNF)

**SNP:** [rs6265(A;G)](http://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Rs6265)

> Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophin that is involved in both the growth of new neurons, proliferation (or expansion) of existing neurons, and in the maintenance of synapses. ~ Rhonda Patrick

The _A allele_ is linked to lower levels of _BDNF_. Individuals with _A allele_ can increase _BDNF_ through physical activity according to [this study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23907543/).

I personally try to get in two four-mile, hilly runs a week (hills make it more like [high-intensity interval training](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-intensity_interval_training)). I do hot yoga three times a week and strength train two or three times per week.

## Perform High-load, Low-Repetition Strength and HIIT Training

**Gene:** [ACTN3](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/ACTN3)

**SNP:** [rs1815739(C;T)](https://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Rs1815739)

Individuals with this SNP are recommended to choose HIIT based on [this study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4624116/).

## Supplement with Fish Oil

**Gene:** [FADS2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9415)

**SNP:** [rs1535(A;G)](https://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Rs1535)

This genotype has been associated with a 27% decrease in the efficiency in conversion of ALA (alpha-â€‹linolenic acid-- found in plant sources like flax seeds, etc.) to omega-3 EPA.  Optimal _omega-3 EPA_ levels are required for optimal brain health and also have anti-inflammatory properties.

Fish oil is high in _omega-3 EPA_ so this conversion process is not necessary. I take 1 tsp of [Carlson Fish Oil](https://www.amazon.com/Carlson-Finest-Lemon-Norwegian-Omega-3s/dp/B00GA86WR6) in my morning smoothie.

## Eat More Eggs and Organ Meets, Supplement with B-Complex

**Gene:** [MTRR](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/MTHFR)

**SNP:** [rs1801394(A;G)](https://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Rs1801394)

I have the polymorphism in the _MTHR gene_ that is associated with an altered [choline](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Choline-Consumer/) metabolism. Choline is an important nutrient for brain and nervous system health. The best sources of choline are eggs and organ meets like liver.

This polymorphism also has been associated with high [homocysteine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homocysteine). This can be mitigated by having a proper levels of Vitamin B12 (which liver is a also a great source of). In addition, [Betaine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betaine) has also [been shown to lower homocysteine levels](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23997720).

## Practice Time-restricted Eating; Stop Eating after 5PM

**Gene:** [NPAS2](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/NPAS2)

**SNP:** [rs2305160(C;C)](https://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Rs2305160)

This SNP has been associated with an increased risk of certain kinds of cancers. The risk is influenced by fasting insulin levels.

## Decrease Saturated Fat and Refined Sugar

**Gene:** [FABP2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2169)

**SNP:** [i6010053(A;A)](https://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Rs1799883)

This genotype has been associated with increase levels of certain negative biomarkers related to insulin resistence and cholesterol levels when on a higher saturated fat/refined carb diet.

My goal is to avoid all refined carbohydrates, e.g. added sugars, the best I can and to keep saturated fat intake under 20g/day.

## Avoid Alcohol and Optimize Sleep

**Gene:** [APOE](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/APOE)

**SNP:** [rs4420638(A;G)](https://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Rs4420638)

I am APOE4-positive, meaning I have higher risks for developing [Alzheimer's Disease](https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-alzheimers). The risks can be mitigated however by lifestyle factors like optimizing sleep, being physically active and avoiding drugs like alcohol.

I optimize sleep by getting early light exposure (I usually take my dog for an early morning walk), keeping my sleeping quarters dark and cool at night, and not consuming caffeine after 12pm.
