title: Combining Baroque Music and the Pomodoro Technique with Baroqodoro.com
---

Combining two skills or interests can be a powerful way of making something new and interesting. I created [Baroqodoro.com](https://baroqodoro.com/) to combine two things I find valuable-- the _pomodoro technique_ and _baroque music_. [Pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) is a time management technique where cycles of focus work (usually 25 minutes long) are followed by a short break. In [Cal Newport's book, Deep Work](https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/), he talks about the importance of proper background noise for "deep work". One popular option for background noise is lyricless music like [baroque music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroque_music). From my experience, adding _baroque music_ enhances the focus effect of _pomodoro technique_.

[Baroqodoro.com](https://baroqodoro.com/) is a tool that tracks pomodoros while playing baroque music during focus sessions. If you too use the _pomodoro technique_ and like lyricless musics for background sound, give it a try and let me know what you think!
